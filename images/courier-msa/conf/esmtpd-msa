#  This configuration file sets various options for Courier's mail submission
#  ESMTP server (RFC 2476).  Basically, this is the plain old port 25
#  ESMTP server, with a couple of difference.
#
#  This configuration file is read after esmtpd, therefore it only needs
#  to override some options that would differ from port 25.  The first
#  section of this configuration file sets options that are likely to be
#  different than the esmtpd options.


##NAME: BOFHCHECKDNS:0
#
#  ESMTP MSA is likely to want to verify return domain addresses.

BOFHCHECKDNS=0

##NAME: NOADDMSGID:0
#
#  Add the Message-ID: header, if missing.  The default value for esmtp
#  is 1, but we want it 0 here:

NOADDMSGID=0

##NAME: NOADDDATE:0
#
# Ditto for the Date: header.

NOADDDATE=0

##NAME: NOADDRREWRITE:0
#
# Don't rewrite To:, From:, and Cc: headers.  Set to 2 in order to omit
# rewriting them only if there is a DKIM-Signature.

NOADDRREWRITE=0

##NAME: ESMTP_LOG_DIALOG:0
#
#  If set, log the esmtp dialog.

ESMTP_LOG_DIALOG=1

##NAME: AUTH_REQUIRED:0
#
# Set AUTH_REQUIRED to 1 in order to force the client to use ESMTP
# authentication.  You can override AUTH_REQUIRED on a per-IP address basis
# using smtpaccess.  See makesmtpaccess(8).

AUTH_REQUIRED=0

##NAME: BLACKLISTS: 0
#
# You probably want to turn off any blacklist checking, if you have it
# enabled in esmtpd

BLACKLISTS=""

##NAME: ADDRESS:1
#
#  Address to listen on, can be set to a single IP address.

ADDRESS=0.0.0.0

##NAME: PORT:1
#
#  PORT specified the port number to listen on.  The standard msa port
#  is port 587.
#
#  Multiple port numbers can be separated by commas.  When multiple port
#  numbers are used it is possibly to select a specific IP address for a
#  given port as "ip.port".  For example, "127.0.0.1.900,192.68.0.1.900"
#  accepts connections on port 900 on IP addresses 127.0.0.1 and 192.68.0.1
#  The ADDRESS setting, if given, is a default for ports that do not have
#  a specified IP address.

PORT=587,25

##NAME: PIDFILE:0
#
#  We *MUST* use a different PID file than esmtpd!!!
#

PIDFILE=/usr/lib/courier/var/tmp/esmtpd-msa.pid

##NAME: ACCESSFILE:1
#
#  You can use a different access file for esmtp-msa than for esmtp.
#  To do that, create it yourself, and use makesmtpaccess-msa instead of
#  makesmtpaccess.

ACCESSFILE=${sysconfdir}/smtpaccess

##NAME: ESMTPDSTART:0
#
# ESMTPDSTART is not referenced anywhere in the standard Courier programs
# or scripts.  Rather, this is a convenient flag to be read by your system
# startup script in /etc/rc.d, like this:
#
#  prefix=/usr/lib/courier
#  exec_prefix=/usr/lib/courier
#  . ${sysconfdir}/esmtpd
#  . ${sysconfdir}/esmtpd-msa
#  case x$ESMTPDSTART in
#  x[yY]*)
#        /usr/lib/courier/sbin/esmtpd-msa start
#        ;;
#  esac
#
# The default setting is going to be NO, until Courier is shipped by default
# with enough platforms so that people get annoyed with having to flip it to
# YES every time.

ESMTPDSTART=NO

##NAME: SYSLOGNAME:0
#
# Name that courieresmtpd uses to log to syslog
#
# SYSLOGNAME=courieresmtpd

##NAME: CUSTOM:1
#
# Here, you can stick it any additional esmtpd settings that you want to
# override.  Some of the ones you are likely to want overriden may include
# MAXDAEMONS, MAXPERC, MAXPERIP, AUTHMODULES, ESMTPAUTH, and ESMTPAUTH_TLS.
# If you want to override them, do it here:
#

##NAME: MAXDAEMONS:1

MAXDAEMONS=40

##NAME: MAXPERC:1

MAXPERC=5

##NAME: MAXPERIP:1

MAXPERIP=5
