# Use the following entry to deny connections from bad IP addresses
#
# 192.168.5	deny

# Another way to block mail from IP addresses is by initializing the
# BLOCK variable to a non-empty value.  This is enforced in submit.

# 192.168.5	allow,BLOCK="550 Shoo! Go away!"

# If 192.168.2.3 is listed in a blocklist that initializes the BLOCK
# environment variable, and you wish to whitelist the IP address, just
# set BLOCK to an empty value, like this:
#
# 192.168.2.3	allow,BLOCK
