#                  Runtime configuration file for Exim               #
######################################################################


# This configuration file is modified from the default for the purposes
# of the SMTP garden project.

# The configuration manual is at:
# https://www.exim.org/exim-html-current/doc/html/spec_html/index.html

# This file is divided into several parts, all but the first of which are
# headed by a line starting with the word "begin". Only those parts that
# are required need to be present. Blank lines, and lines starting with #
# are ignored.

########### IMPORTANT ########## IMPORTANT ########### IMPORTANT ###########
#                                                                          #
# Whenever you change Exim's configuration file, you *must* remember to    #
# HUP the Exim daemon, because it will not pick up the new configuration   #
# until you do. However, any other Exim processes that are started, for    #
# example, a process started by an MUA in order to send a message, will    #
# see the new configuration as soon as it is in place.                     #
#                                                                          #
# You do not need to HUP the daemon for changes in auxiliary files that    #
# are referenced from this file. They are read every time they are used.   #
#                                                                          #
# It is usually a good idea to test a new configuration for syntactic      #
# correctness before installing it (for example, by running the command    #
# "exim -C /config/file.new -bV").                                         #
#                                                                          #

# The settings below cause Exim to make RFC 1413 (ident) callbacks
# for all incoming SMTP calls. You can limit the hosts to which these
# calls are made, and/or change the timeout that is used. If you set
# the timeout to zero, all RFC 1413 calls are disabled. RFC 1413 calls
# are cheap and can provide useful information for tracing problem
# messages, but some hosts and firewalls have problems with them.
# This can result in a timeout instead of an immediate refused
# connection, leading to delays on starting up SMTP sessions.
# (The default was reduced from 30s to 5s for release 4.61. and to
# disabled for release 4.86)

# Enable an efficiency feature.  We advertise the feature; clients
# may request to use it.  For multi-recipient mails we then can
# reject or accept per-user after the message is received.
# This supports recipient-dependent content filtering; without it
# you have to temp-reject any recipients after the first that have
# incompatible filtering, and do the filtering in the data ACL.
# Even with this enabled, you must support the old style for peers
# not flagging support for PRDR (visible via $prdr_requested).

# By default, Exim expects all envelope addresses to be fully qualified, that

# unqualified addresses (just a local part) from certain hosts, you can specify
# these hosts by setting one or both of

sender_unqualified_hosts = *
recipient_unqualified_hosts = *

# to control sender and recipient addresses, respectively. When this is done,
# unqualified addresses are qualified using the settings of qualify_domain
# and/or qualify_recipient (see above).

# detail than the default.  Adjust to suit.

# If you want Exim to support the "percent hack" for certain domains,
# uncomment the following line and provide a list of domains. The "percent
# hack" is the feature by which mail addressed to x%y@z (where z is one of
# the domains listed) is locally rerouted to x@y and sent on. If z is not one
# of the "percent hack" domains, x%y is treated as an ordinary local part. This
# hack is rarely needed nowadays; you should not enable it unless you are sure
# that you really need it.

# As well as setting this option you will also need to remove the test
# for local parts containing % in the ACL definition below.


# When Exim can neither deliver a message nor return it to sender, it "freezes"
# the delivery error message (aka "bounce message"). There are also other
# circumstances in which messages get frozen. They will stay on the queue for
# ever unless one of the following options is set.

# This option unfreezes frozen bounce messages after two days, tries
# once more to deliver them, and ignores any delivery failures.

# NOTE: Keep this comment section present for smtp garden
# If you're in a part of the world where ASCII is not sufficient for most
# text, then you're probably familiar with RFC2047 message header extensions.
# By default, Exim adheres to the specification, including a limit of 76
# characters to a line, with encoded words fitting within a line.
# If you wish to use decoded headers in message filters in such a way
# that successful decoding of malformed messages matters, you may wish to
# configure Exim to be more lenient.
#
# check_rfc2047_length = false
#
# In particular, the Exim maintainers have had multiple reports of problems
# from Russian administrators of issues until they disable this check,
# because of some popular, yet buggy, mail composition software.


# If you wish to be strictly RFC compliant, or if you know you'll be
# exchanging email with systems that are not 8-bit clean, then you may
# wish to disable advertising 8BITMIME.  Uncomment this option to do so.
